# Hacker-News-Posts
Hacker News is a website where users submit posts that other users can comment on. There are two main types of posts, "Ask HN" and "Show HN". "Ask HN" are specific questions users submit while "Show HN" are specific projects or pieces of work users submit.

With the data we are given, we are trying to find out which of the two main types of posts receive more comments on average. We will also determine if posting at certain times of the day is more advantageous when trying to receive more comments on average.
